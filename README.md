"A foot traffic tracking and management system running on raspberry Pi which uses data packets in the air and reads them to get the MAC Address of the mobile device and processes that data to get the trend of traffic flow on an area. This will help manage public space better by reporting congestion points.
It will present the all the traffic in a mobile app in which people can check the number of people in a place in real-time. 
It will use a RasPi mesh network and an EC2 machine/localhost.
It will also process that data through an ML Algorithm which will predict time with the lowest traffic."
